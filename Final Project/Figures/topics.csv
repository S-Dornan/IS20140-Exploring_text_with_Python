0,Modelling point rainfall occurrences with the Modified Bartlett-Lewis Rectangular Pulses Model,"A six parameter stochastic point process model, known as the modified Bartlett-Lewis Rectangular Pulses Model, is applied to fairly long hourly rainfall data recorded at Valentia (relatively a wet location) and Shannon Airport (relatively a dry location), Ireland. Five different sets of statistics of the rainfall data of each month, assuming local stationarity within the month, are used to estimate the parameters and to simulate model output. The problems of parameter stability/sensitivity and identification are discussed and it has been shown that the sensitivity of the model parameters to the choice of six statistics can be avoided by estimating the six parameters by optimization from 16 statistics namely mean, variance, lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient and proportion dry of hourly, 6-hourly, 12-hourly, and 24-hourly rainfalls. Some useful properties of the rainfall depth process are analysed using the notion of event-based statistics. The conditional distributions of rainfall depth and maximum intensity, mean event profiles, and various other features of the rainfall depth process obtained from the model simulated samples compare favourably with the historical ones.",The rainstorms and thunderstorms.
1,MODELING CATCHMENT EVAPORATION - AN OBJECTIVE COMPARISON OF THE PENMAN AND MORTON APPROACHES,"Water-balance data from the Shannon catchment are used to calibrate two simple models of catchment-scale evaporation. The first uses the more traditional approach: evaporation is taken as Penman potential evaporation (PE), unless water is not freely available, in which case the reduction of actual evaporation (AE) from PE is calculated using a simple Thornthwaite-style soil-moisture model. The second model makes use of the relatively recent work by Bouchet and Morton which suggests, inter alia, that AE and PE are inversely related in the absence of an abundant supply of moisture. The resulting objective criteria of efficiency for the final models are similar, but other results from the model calibration process indicate some of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two models. In particular, it is shown that the Bouchet-Morton approach provides a valuable alternative to the empiricism of the Thornthwaite-style reduction of AE from PE, but that this is achieved at a high cost: the introduction of a strong degree of empiricism into the process of advection modelling.",Environmental stewardship and respect
2,"Sub-recent changes in annual average water level in the Shannon estuary, western Ireland","This paper describes results to date on work to reconstruct the pattern of sub-recent water level changes within the Shannon Estuary, western Ireland. The main database for the study covers the period 1949 to 2002, and includes observed tide gauge data and hydrological data. Routine statistical analyses are used to plot the relative position of the water surface through time, and to assess the relative significance of the components of an averaged water level curve that has been developed for Limerick City Dock at the head of the estuary. The findings form part of a larger project that aims to develop a time series of Mean Water Levels, Mean High Water Levels, Mean Low Water Levels and Mean Tidal Range in the context of human modification of the estuary since the mid-19(th) C, including land reclamation and environmental responses to predicted sea level changes. The newly assembled data presented indicate that average water levels have changed significantly between 1949 and 2002, including a clear overall rise in water surface elevation within the study period and particularly within the last decade. This paper quantifies the degree and rate of change evident from the averaged water level curve and explores the possible causes of the trend.",Water level change and land reclamation
3,Hybrid Data-Driven Models for Hydrological Simulation and Projection on the Catchment Scale,"Changes in streamflow within catchments can have a significant impact on agricultural production, as soil moisture loss, as well as frequent drying and wetting, may have an effect on the nutrient availability of many soils. In order to predict future changes and explore the impact of different scenarios, machine learning techniques have been used recently in the hydrological sector for simulation streamflow. This paper compares the use of four different models, namely artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machine regression (SVR), wavelet-ANN, and wavelet-SVR as surrogate models for a geophysical hydrological model to simulate the long-term daily water level and water flow in the River Shannon hydrological system in Ireland. The performance of the models has been tested for multi-lag values and for forecasting both short- and long-term time scales. For simulating the water flow of the catchment hydrological system, the SVR-based surrogate model performs best overall. Regarding modeling the water level on the catchment scale, the hybrid model wavelet-ANN performs the best among all the constructed models. It is shown that the data-driven methods are useful for exploring hydrological changes in a large multi-station catchment, with low computational cost.","Water, sediment, and flood"
4,GEO-CWB: GIS-Based Algorithms for Parametrising the Responses of Catchment Dynamic Water Balance Regarding Climate and Land Use Changes,"Parametrising the spatially distributed dynamic catchment water balance is a critical factor in studying the hydrological system responses to climate and land use changes. This study presents the development of a geographic information system (GIS)-based set of algorithms (geographical spatially distributed water balance model (GEO-CWB)), which is developed from integrating physical, statistical, and machine learning models. The GEO-CWB tool has been developed to simulate and predict future spatially distributed dynamic water balance using GIS environment at the catchment scale in response to the future changes in climate variables and land use through a user-friendly interface. The tool helps in bridging the gap in quantifying the high-resolution dynamic water balance components for the large catchments by reducing the computational costs. Also, this paper presents the application and validation of GEO-CWB on the Shannon catchment in Ireland as an example of a large and complicated hydrological system. It can be concluded that climate and land use changes have significant effects on the spatial and temporal patterns of the different water balance components of the catchment.",Climate and land use changes
5,The geochemistry of Irish rivers,"Study region: Ireland Study focus: Multiple studies have established that catchment geology and weathering regime strongly influence surface water chemistry, and that geochemical cycling can vary due to seasonal climatic conditions. However, fewer studies have focused on the influence these controls in a holistic manner. We relate the water chemistry of a country-wide Irish river survey to atmospheric input, underlying geology, and the influence of bogs. Climatic conditions were defined by an atypically wet winter and an unusually dry summer, providing the opportunity to investigate river chemistry variation across hydrologic conditions. Sampling included 21 of Ireland's 22 largest rivers ranked by discharge, first-order and second-order streams draining bog lands, a second-order stream draining a limestone catchment, and downstream transects along the River Shannon. All samples were analyzed for major elements, selected trace elements, and nutrients, and a subset was analyzed for delta S-34(SO4). New hydrological insights: Most catchments were dominated by carbonate weathering with little contribution from the weathering of aluminosilicates. River water composition also varied geographically along the prevailing wind direction due to inputs from marine aerosols, with additional weathering components important in some systems. Seasonal influences could be seen in the chemistry of the headwaters of the River Shannon, while the lower reaches of the river exhibited less variable behavior throughout seasonal changes, likely due to the influence of lakes in the River Shannon system.",Water chemistry and weathering
6,"Source of the River Shannon, Ireland","The Shannon is the longest river in the British Isles (280 km) and drains an area of about 15,530 km(2). The source of the river is Shannon Pot, a karst rising in County Cavan, which is one of the most famous springs in Ireland. Water tracer experiments have shown that the rising drains an immediate area of about 12.8 km(2) on the slopes of Cuilcagh Mountain, of which about 60% is underlain by limestone. However, two sinks 10-11 km east of the rising and ca. 200 m higher have also been shown to be hydrologically connected during high flow conditions. This suggests that Shannon Pot may once have had a substantially larger catchment area.","Water, sediment, and flood"
7,Dealing with Multisource Information for Estuarine Flood Risk Appraisal in Two Western European Coastal Areas,"Estuaries are usually affected by compound flooding triggers that cause diverse territorial damages. While fluvial flood risk assessment frameworks are well established in the literature, integrated management instruments that deal with estuarine flood risk remain incomplete and often lacking. This research presents a methodology to extract relevant information from multiple sources post-event and a database building process that is applied to two contrasting estuaries (the Tagus River estuary in Portugal, and the Shannon River estuary in Ireland) in the Western European coastal area. Overall, a total of 274 documents were analyzed and the information was stored in two databases. Multiple correspondence analysis was applied to extract the most informative and relevant estuarine flood indicators. An integrated estuarine flood risk assessment framework is presented and discussed based on the extracted indicators. The framework is driven by two distinct dimensions (oceanic and hydrographic) and revealed the transversal position of triggers of estuarine floods, reflecting the compounding effects usually present in these areas. The results also highlight two levels of flood risk mostly based on damage typology.",Conventional flooding and flood risk assessment frameworks
8,Biodiversity analyses for risk assessment of genetically modified potato,"An environmental risk assessment for the introduction of genetically modified crops includes assessing the consequences for biodiversity. In this study arthropod biodiversity was measured using pitfall traps in potato agro-ecosystems in Ireland and The Netherlands over two years. We tested the impact of site, year, potato genotype, and fungicide management regime on arthropod community composition. Three potato genotypes were compared: the cultivar Desiree, susceptible to the late blight pathogen Phytoplithora infestans, a genetically modified cisgenic clone of Desiree resistant to P. infestans and the cultivar Sarpo Mira, also resistant to late blight. We aimed to test several ways to measure biodiversity in the context of risk assessment by using both univariate biodiversity indices and multivariate ordination methods, categorizing the pitfall trap catch by taxonomic or functional category. The Shannon-Wiener and Simpson biodiversity indices both showed strong differences between sites, years and potato genotypes, but showed no effects of the fungicide management regime. The effect of genotype was due to cultivar differences between Desiree and Sarpo Mira rather than between the GM-event (A15-31) and its isogenic comparator Desiree. Multivariate permutation analyses and RDA ordination confirmed these findings and also showed interactions between year, site and either genotype or treatment. The added value of the multivariate analysis was that it provided information on the specific arthropod groups or taxa that contributed to community structure. Multivariate analyses are recommended for use as a sensitive method to compare functionally important arthropod groups driving community structure within the framework of environmental risk assessments, or for the process of indicator species selection.",Conservation and fairness
9,Disentangling the effects of land use and geo-climatic factors on diversity in European freshwater ecosystems,"Land use effects are considered among the main stressors on freshwater biodiversity, with up to 80% of land in Europe under intensive use. Here, we address the impact of arable and urban landscapes on taxon richness, Shannon Wiener diversity, taxon rareness and taxonomic distinctness of eleven organism groups encompassing vertebrates, invertebrates and plants, occurring in five freshwater ecosystem types across Europe: rivers, floodplains, lakes, ponds and groundwater. In addition, nine geo-climatic descriptors (e.g. latitude, longitude, precipitation) were used to disentangle land use effects from those of natural drivers of biodiversity. Using a variance partitioning scheme based on boosted regression trees and generalised linear regression modelling, we sought: (i) to partition the unique, shared and unexplained variation in the metrics explained by both groups of descriptor variables, (ii) to quantify the contribution of each descriptor variable to biodiversity variation in the most parsimonious regression model and (iii) to identify interactions of land use and natural descriptors. The variation in biodiversity uniquely described by land use was consistently low across both ecosystem types and organism groups. In contrast, geo-climatic descriptors uniquely, and jointly with land use, explained significantly more variance in all 39 biodiversity metrics tested. Regression models revealed significant interactions between geo-climatic descriptors and land use for a third of the models, with interactions accounting for up to 17% of the model's deviance. However, no consistent patterns were observed related to the type of biodiversity metric and organism group considered. Subdividing data according to the strongest geo-climatic gradient in each dataset aimed to reduce the strength of natural descriptors relative to land use. Although data sub-setting can highlight land use effects on freshwater biodiversity, sub-setting our data often failed to produce stronger land use effects. There was no increase in spatial congruence in the subsets, suggesting that the observed land use effects were not dependent on the spatial extent of the subsets. Our results confirm significant joint effects of, and interactions between, land use and natural environmental descriptors on freshwater biodiversity, across ecosystem types and organism groups. This has implications for biodiversity monitoring. First, the combined analysis of anthropogenic and natural descriptors is a prerequisite for the analysis of human threats to biodiversity. Second, geo-climatically, but not necessarily geographically more homogeneous datasets can help unmask the role of anthropogenic descriptors. And third, whole community-based biodiversity metrics (including taxon richness) are not ideal indicators of anthropogenic effects on biodiversity at broad scales. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

10,MAJOR CANAL RECONSTRUCTION IN PEAT AREAS,"The Irish canal system traverses extensive peatland in the midlands. While originally intended for commercial traffic the canal and waterways system is now considered for its amenity value, and considerable investment is being incurred in maintaining and upgrading the system. Significant experience has been gained in understanding the properties and behaviour of peat and in the reconstruction of canals. The Paper sets out some characteristics of peat in Irish midland bogs including its density and moisture content, permeability, shear strength, shrinkage, effective stress and consolidation behaviour. The experience of the Irish Office of Public Works in canal reconstruction is outlined. Particular emphasis is placed on the work involved in reconstructing the Grand Canal, which links Dublin westward to the River Shannon, following a major breach in the midlands in 1989. The analysis of the failure in the section of embanked canal peat bog and the design solution are resented. The repair techniques, involving the reconstruction of about 200 000 m3 embankment and its consolidation and waterproofing, are detailed.","Environmental, social and economic rigour"
11,Spatially distributed potential evapotranspiration modeling and climate projections,"Evapotranspiration integrates energy and mass transfer between the Earth's surface and atmosphere and is the most active mechanism linking the atmosphere, hydrosphsophere, lithosphere and biosphere. This study focuses on the fine resolution modeling and projection of spatially distributed potential evapotranspiration on the large catchment scale as response to climate change. Six potential evapotranspiration designed algorithms, systematically selected based on a structured criteria and data availability, have been applied and then validated to long-term mean monthly data for the Shannon River catchment with a 50 m(2) cell size. The best validated algorithm was therefore applied to evaluate the possible effect of future climate change on potential evapotranspiration rates. Spatially distributed potential evapotranspiration projections have been modeled based on climate change projections from multi-GCM ensembles for three future time intervals (2020, 2050 and 2080) using a range of different Representative Concentration Pathways producing four scenarios for each time interval. Finally, seasonal results have been compared to baseline results to evaluate the impact of climate change on the potential evapotranspiration and there for on the catchment dynamical water balance. The results present evidence that the modeled climate change scenarios would have a significant impact on the future potential evapotranspiration rates. All the simulated scenarios predicted an increase in potential evapotranspiration for each modeled future time interval, which would significantly affect the dynamical catchment water balance. This study addresses the gap in the literature of using GIS-based algorithms to model fine-scale spatially distributed potential evapotranspiration on the large catchment systems based on climatological observations and simulations in different climatological zones. Providing fine-scale potential evapotranspiration data is very crucial to assess the dynamical catchment water balance to setup management scenarios for the water abstractions. This study illustrates a transferable systematic method to design GIS-based algorithms to simulate spatially distributed potential evapotranspiration on the large catchment systems.

12,Predation and competition effects on the size diversity of aquatic communities,"Body size has been widely recognised as a key factor determining community structure in ecosystems. We analysed size diversity patterns of phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish assemblages in 13 data sets from freshwater and marine sites with the aim to assess whether there is a general trend in the effect of predation and resource competition on body size distribution across a wide range of aquatic ecosystems. We used size diversity as a measure of the shape of size distribution. Size diversity was computed based on the Shannon-Wiener diversity expression, adapted to a continuous variable, i.e. as body size. Our results show that greater predation pressure was associated with reduced size diversity of prey at all trophic levels. In contrast, competition effects depended on the trophic level considered. At upper trophic levels (zooplankton and fish), size distributions were more diverse when potential resource availability was low, suggesting that competitive interactions for resources promote diversification of aquatic communities by size. This pattern was not found for phytoplankton size distributions where size diversity mostly increased with low zooplankton grazing and increasing nutrient availability. Relationships we found were weak, indicating that predation and competition are not the only determinants of size distribution. Our results suggest that predation pressure leads to accumulation of organisms in the less predated sizes, while resource competition tends to favour a wider size distribution.",Resource competition and predation
13,How many dimensions of biodiversity do we need?,"Biodiversity is a measure of the total difference within a biological system. It is understood to arise at genetic, species and multiple levels of community organisation, hence is multidimensional in nature. Biodiversity indices have proliferated in attempts to capture this complexity but may now have confounded it. Here we attempt a reduction to the minimal set of metrics needed to describe biodiversity (often by default taken to be species richness). 1000 model communities with realistic taxonomic composition were synthesised using databases of marine benthic species. A battery of 19 biodiversity indices were calculated for every community and analysed by PCA to show inter-dependence and sensitivity to variation in taxonomic (a surrogate for genetic), functional (based on ecological roles) and structural (based on species abundance) diversity. We found the three major axes of biodiversity were (a) structural complexity, and (b) two different mixtures of taxonomic and functional diversity: it was well approximated by a three-dimensional space of these variables. A scalar distance from the origin of this space could serve as a single valued summary where needed, for example in economic valuations. The most widely used single biodiversity measure - species richness - missed 88.6% of the diversity, emphasising the importance of additional characters and the need for species databases to record functional traits, presence and abundance in communities, and phylogenetic information.

14,The influence of habitat heterogeneity on bird diversity in Irish farmland,"The intensification and specialisation of agricultural practices have led to a widespread decline of farmland bird diversity across much of Europe. Increasing habitat heterogeneity at Multiple Spatial scales has been suggested as one possible strategy to reverse these declines. This study examined the relationship between habitat heterogeneity, as ineasured by a nurnbcr ofindices, and bird diversity at farm scale using study sites in the east and south-east of Ireland. Generalised Linear Models indicated that there was a positive relationship between the documented heterogeneity of farmland habitats and the numbers of bird species observed during standardised farm surveys. However, this relationship was not evident when bird diversity was quantified using both the Shannon and the Simpson's diversity indices. It is concluded that agri-environmental policy that aims to influence the heterogeneity of habitats at the farm level can provide a useful means to maintain farmland biodiversity. Future research should aim to develop in improved system of habitat classification and a deeper understanding of the ecological value of different habitat types in Irish farmland.",The main themes in this article are:
15,Comparison of benthic macroinvertebrate indices for the assessment of the impact of acid mine drainage on an Irish river below an abandoned Cu-S mine,"A range of macroinvertebrate indices were compared to assess the most appropriate metric for the assessment of acid mine drainage (AMD) in a low alkalinity, highly erosional river in south-east Ireland. Differences were found in the ability of indices to discriminate AMD impact with the Brillouin, BMWP score, Margalef and Shannon Indices the most precise. Taxon richness was also strongly correlated with AMD indicator parameters (e.g. pH alkalinity, sulphate, Zn and Fe) at impacted sites being an equally reliable metric. The response of the community structure to AMD in this river does not fulfil the optimum criteria for either diversity or biological indices, which may explain the variation in the success of different indices seen in this and other studies. The development of indices that model the expected community response to AMD more accurately or are based on the response of indicator species to AMD pollutants are required. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

16,"Historic land reclamation in the intertidal wetlands of the Shannon estuary, western Ireland","There is abundant landscape evidence for extensive land reclamation conducted within the Shannon estuary wetlands. To date, little published research is available which identifies how much reclamation, has occurred,, its timing and the likely environmental implications. This paper addresses these questions on the basis of available cartographic and documentary data on land reclamation in this area. Identification of reclaimed land was based on the 2nd Edition Ordnance Survey of Ireland Map Series of 1924. These maps represent landscape features relating to reclamation, such as embankments, artificial arterial drainage channels and sluices. Using such indicators for the purpose of demarcation, the extent of the lands reclaimed has been mapped. Documentary information on reclamation schemes was acquired from the National Archives files on the Irish Quit Rent Office, including letters, memoranda, draft bills and Government Acts, legal documents and statements of account, and these support and supplement cartographic data. In total, approximately 6,500ha of the Shannon estuary lowlands were reclaimed for agriculture and other purposes. This has significantly altered the morphometric characteristics of the estuary, as embankments and revetments for flood protection have reduced the potential energy dissipation area and the water storage capacity of the estuarine wetlands. Reclamation has resulted in modification of the estuarine physical environment and its hydrodynamics, and altered the character of the wetland habitat in the estuary environs.",Reclamation and reclamation
17,Consequences of hydraulic dredging for a razor clam Ensis siliqua (L.) bed in the north-west Irish sea,"The Gormanstown razor clam bed, which measured 21km(2) in extent in 1998, provided more than half the razor clams harvested in Europe for three years, 1999-2001. Exploitation of the bed commenced in late 1997. As a result of hydraulic dredging, the sediments have higher sorting coefficients and some larger grades were added in the form of shell fragments in the intervening years. The macrobenthos of the bed was monitored over a period of seven years, beginning one year after exploitation commenced. Throughout that time the dominant species, Ensis siliqua, which had accounted for up to 90% of the biomass in the first year of the study, declined to approximately 50% in 2005. Ensis siliqua displays the characteristics of a K-selected species: heavy standing biomass, type one survivorship curve and slow replication. Coinciding with exploitation, the bed was invaded by other deposit and suspension-feeding bivalves, notably Pharus legumen and Lutraria lutraria whose population expansion can be traced to the early dredge fishery. The ratio of Ensis to Lutraria sampled weights was 124:1 in 1998, but it steadily advanced to 1.2:1 in 2005. Thus Lutraria, another suspension feeder, has displaced the razor clam. The Shannon-Wiener index of diversity rose as exploitation of the bed progressed, and in 2005 (eight years after dredging commenced), it had not returned to its 1998 level. However, the trend over the period was downwards, suggesting that a new stability involving a different species composition may be achieved. An age length key applied to length-frequency distributions of E. siliqua indicated that no age class older than age eleven has accounted for 10% of the population since 2001, although that was usually the case in the four preceding years.",Diversity and diversification of the species.
18,Hydroperiod and Traditional Farming Practices Drive Plant Community Composition on Unregulated Atlantic Floodplain Meadows,"The River Shannon, Ireland, among the last unregulated rivers in western Europe, has extensive floodplains and supports rare and endangered species and habitats, of ecological and cultural importance. Unregulated floodplains result in community composition responding directly to natural fluctuations in water level. This study assesses how hydrological factors and farming practices effect flood meadow plant communities. Three main plant communities were identified, forming an uninterrupted ecotone, along a gradient of dry to wet. Habitats of European conservation interest (Lowland Hay Meadows and Molinia Meadows) were well represented. Hydroperiod, calculated using microtopographical measurements, was the primary factor determining community composition and was negatively correlated with elevation and plant species richness. The botanical continuum comprised a range of insect-pollinated species, demonstrating the role of floodplains in providing pollinator services. Climate change projections indicate more prolonged winter flooding in the future, signifying potential range shifts for these plant species and communities; highlighting the need for appropriate conservation measures in the surrounding landscape. Low-intensity farming practices, with minimal fertiliser use and regular hay-mowing, played an essential, secondary role in maintaining plant species diversity. Retaining the floodplain topography, its associated hydrological regime and low-intensity farming practices, are necessary to maintain species diversity and ecosystem services.",Conservation and adaptation
19,Cruise visitor impressions of the environment of the Shannon-Erne waterways system,"This paper examines visitor reactions to a varied inland water environment and the management implications that result. It is based on a survey of cruising on the interlinked systems of Lough Erne, the Shannon-Erne Waterway and the River Shannon in north-west Ireland. Knowledge of visitors' demands and reactions to water bodies and bankside features is considered vital to the successful management of waterways, particularly in the context of developing a sustainable tourism product that demands the preservation of the integrity of the environment. The study is opportune in that the 1994 reopening of the Shannon-Erne Waterway allows the implementation of safeguards at an early stage of development when scope for influencing the future is greater. The results are useful in providing an insight into what visitors value, so that these can be considered while simultaneously providing for expansion in an economically deprived region. An incomplete understanding of the environmental system is evident in the common assumption that no conflicts exist. Specific considerations for management include the need to preserve the core features of an unspoiled and tranquil rural landscape through careful siting of additional mooring sites and other infrastructural support, and zonation and other restrictions on more intrusive water-sports. Some false perceptions of environmental conditions need countering through provision of information, and a code of practice is required to minimize depletions of fish stocks that provide an important ancillary recreational activity. Present pressures on the natural environment are not great, but may grow following initial good publicity, although much is dependent upon political events in Northern Ireland.

20,Small rain events during drought alter sediment dissolved organic carbon leaching and respiration in intermittent stream sediments,"With climate change, streams and rivers are at increased risk of droughts and flow intermittency. The full implications of these conditions for fluvial carbon (C) processing and stream-atmosphere CO2 emissions are not well understood. We performed a controlled drought experiment in outdoor hyporheic flumes. We simulated small rain events that increase sediment moisture content, but do not cause streamflow in order to investigate how these events affect streambed dissolved organic C dynamics, biofilm respiration and enzyme activity, and bacterial community composition. Flumes were subject to a non-flow phase of one month with small rain events with varying frequency (weekly, 3 x weekly, and no rain). Sediment was sampled at the surface and from the hyporheic zone at the end of the non-flow phase. We quantified microbial respiration of the dry sediments and sediment DOC leaching after simulated flow resumption. We found that, at the surface, more frequent rain events significantly increased microbial respiration from 12.6 +/- 0.25 mu g CO2 g(-1) DW h(-1) to 26.5 +/- 11.3 mu g CO2 g(-1) DW h(-1) between the control and 3 x weekly rain events. The average amount of DOC leached from surface sediments during flow resumption was reduced by 0.813 +/- 0.62 mg L-1 with more frequent rain events. More frequent rain events also resulted in the leaching of fresher DOM with increased tryptophan fluorescence and a higher BIX. This, along with higher glucosidase activity in the biofilms, indicates higher OC processing during the drought period with more frequent rain events. Small rain events also enhanced Shannon diversity of microbial communities, with a stronger presence of 'terrestrial-like' bacterial clades. We propose that rain events during drought, even those of small size, are highly relevant for fluvial organic C processing during the dry phase. Future research should explicitly consider small rain events when investigating C fluxes in intermittent streams to fully understand the C processing in these systems with climate change. We conclude that small rain events impact DOM dynamics during reflow and likely impact the cascading C processing in the downstream river network.","Water, temperature, and bacterial community composition"
21,"ENVIRONMENTAL AND VEGETATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS OF LAKES, FENS AND TURLOUGHS IN THE BURREN","The limestone country of the eastern Burren includes permanent lakes, extensive fens, and turloughs-depressions characterised by large fluctuations in water levels that become dry in summer and have distinctive vegetation. Most of the larger lakes lie on an almost level surface, draining southwards via the River Fergus into the Shannon estuary; Lough Bunny drains through the limestone north towards Galway Bay. Field evidence indicates that the lakes and fens, whether they flood in winter or not, have a relatively constant summer water level, probably because the underlying limestone is sealed by glacial drift. Their vegetation follows a normal hydrosere succession from open-water deposits (mostly calcareous marl) to reed swamp and Schoenus fen, culminating locally in raised bog. Present-day exposed expanses of marl are products of erosion of a former peat cover. Turloughs are characterised by unconstrained fluctuations of the water level through most or all of its vertical range. They occur where there is no barrier at the surface to drainage into the limestone, but there is sufficient hydraulic resistance to underground flow to allow water levels to rise during winter and after heavy rain. The vegetation of typical turloughs has more in common with dune slack or flood meadow communities than with true fens.",Changing water levels
22,Drivers of temporal changes in temperate forest plant diversity vary across spatial scales,"Global biodiversity is affected by numerous environmental drivers. Yet, the extent to which global environmental changes contribute to changes in local diversity is poorly understood. We investigated biodiversity changes in a meta-analysis of 39 resurvey studies in European temperate forests (3988 vegetation records in total, 17-75years between the two surveys) by assessing the importance of (i) coarse-resolution (i.e., among sites) vs. fine-resolution (i.e., within sites) environmental differences and (ii) changing environmental conditions between surveys. Our results clarify the mechanisms underlying the direction and magnitude of local-scale biodiversity changes. While not detecting any net local diversity loss, we observed considerable among-site variation, partly explained by temporal changes in light availability (a local driver) and density of large herbivores (a regional driver). Furthermore, strong evidence was found that presurvey levels of nitrogen deposition determined subsequent diversity changes. We conclude that models forecasting future biodiversity changes should consider coarse-resolution environmental changes, account for differences in baseline environmental conditions and for local changes in fine-resolution environmental conditions.",Global environmental changes and changing environmental conditions
23,Thermal effluents from power plants boost performance of the invasive clam Corbicula fluminea in Ireland's largest river,"Elevated temperatures due to anthropogenic activities can improve the performance of non-native species that are adapted to higher temperatures than resident species. Ecosystems may experience higher temperature due to global stressors, such as climate change, or local stressors, including thermal effluents and urban heat islands. Using field surveys of population density and body size of the highly invasive and hot-adapted clam Corbicula fluminea in and out of two thermal effluents from power plants along the River Shannon, Ireland, we tested the hypothesis that C. fluminea performs better in thermal plumes. Shell length and body mass of C. fluminea in thermal effluents were 1.8 and 4.4 times higher, respectively, compared with adjacent unheated river sections. Density of C. fluminea was 13.7 times higher in heated, compared with unheated river reaches, leading to an increase in combined biomass per unit area of >50-fold. Our temperature data suggest an up to 2.5-fold increase of degree-days for growth and up to 5.2-fold increase of degree-days for larval incubation in the thermal plumes in River Shannon, compared with unheated conditions. Through enlarged body size, the elevated temperatures likely increase fecundity within the plumes.These findings illustrate that, in temperate climates, thermal plumes can form sanctuaries, where C. fluminea likely alters habitat, outpaces competitors and potentially dominates the energy flow through food webs. Furthermore, thermal plumes can act as stepping-stones and propagule banks for further proliferation of C. fluminea and other warm-adapted invaders. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

24,Controls on the contemporary distribution of lake thecamoebians (testate amoebae) within the Greater Toronto Area and their potential as water quality indicators,"Thecamoebians were examined from 71 surface sediment samples collected from 21 lakes and ponds in the Greater Toronto Area to (1) elucidate the controls on faunal distribution in modern lake environments; and (2) to consider the utility of thecamoebians in quantitative studies of water quality change. This area was chosen because it includes a high density of kettle and other lakes which are threatened by urban development and where water quality has deteriorated locally as a result of contaminant inputs, particularly nutrients. Fifty-eight samples yielded statistically significant thecamoebian populations. The most diverse faunas (highest Shannon Diversity Index values) were recorded in lakes beyond the limits of urban development, although the faunas of all lakes showed signs of sub-optimal conditions. The assemblages were divided into five clusters using Q-mode cluster analysis, supported by Detrended Correspondence Analysis. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to examine species-environment relationships and to explain the observed clusterings. Twenty-four measured environmental variables were considered, including water property attributes (e.g., pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen), substrate characteristics, sediment-based phosphorus (Olsen P) and 11 environmentally available metals. The thecamoebian assemblages showed a strong association with phosphorus, reflecting the eutrophic status of many of the lakes, and locally to elevated conductivity measurements, which appear to reflect road salt inputs associated with winter de-icing operations. Substrate characteristics, total organic carbon and metal contaminants (particularly Cu and Mg) also influenced the faunas of some samples. A series of partial CCAs show that of the measured variables, sedimentary phosphorus has the largest influence on assemblage distribution, explaining 6.98% (P < 0.002) of the total variance. A transfer function was developed for sedimentary phosphorus (Olsen P) using 58 samples from 15 of the studied lakes. The best performing model was based on weighted averaging with inverse deshrinking (WA Inv, r (jack) (2) = 0.33, RMSEP = 102.65 ppm). This model was applied to a small modern thecamoebian dataset from a eutrophic lake in northern Ontario to predict phosphorus and performed satisfactorily. This preliminary study confirms that thecamoebians have considerable potential as quantitative water quality indicators in urbanising regions, particularly in areas influenced by nutrient inputs and road salts.",Biological diversity and land use
25,Phenology and species diversity in a Lake Huron ichthyoplankton community: Ecological implications of invasive species dominance,"Ichthyoplankton communities are dynamic and vary spatiotemporally based on factors such as wind, water currents, and phenology. Nonetheless, ichthyoplankton are an indicator of spawning success in fish populations and examining their community diversity and composition can serve to provide information on ecosystem integrity. Although some ichthyoplankton species may be transient, understanding their distribution in space and time provides information on species composition, abundance, and habitat use during critical early life stages. We sampled the spring-summer ichthyoplankton community during 2008 and 2009 in northern Lake Huron to determine species succession, abundance, and species diversity along physical and environmental gradients. Seasonal succession of species was similar during both years, indicating well-defined patterns in spawning by northern Lake Huron fish populations. Invasive alewife, rainbow smelt, and round goby were the dominant species during both years, with native stickleback species also abundant. Shannon Entropy (H') increased with increasing water temperature until late summer when H' declined. H' decreased with increasing bottom depth and distance to tributary mouth indicating the important ecological role of these habitat features during early life stages. Although ichthyoplankton diversity was comparable to or higher than that reported for other areas of the Great Lakes, the prominence of invasive species in our study is reflective of the disturbed state of the lake Huron fish community, despite large reductions in invasive planktivorous fish since 2004. Continued monitoring of ichthyoplankton communities will be important for measuring the impacts of species invasions or other ecosystem stressors on fish community structure in the Great Lakes.

26,Challenges in monitoring mobile populations: Applying bayesian multi-site mark-recapture abundance estimation to the monitoring of a highly mobile coastal population of bottlenose dolphins,"Monitoring the abundance of mobile and wide-ranging cetacean populations for conservation management is challenging, especially when the management is focused on static protected areas. Where abundance estimates are derived from mark-recapture data, such as photo-identification of naturally marked individuals, unpredictable movements of animals in and out of the survey area can reduce 'capture' probabilities and affect the precision and accuracy of resulting estimates. A Bayesian hierarchical log-linear model was applied to photo-identification data collected in summer 2014 to derive a multi-site abundance estimate for a population of bottlenose dolphins,Tursiops truncatus, ranging widely throughout the coastal waters of western Ireland. In addition, the effects of varying levels of sampling effort on the minimum detectable decrease in population size were examined. The abundance (median) of dolphins was estimated as 189 (coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean), 0.11; 95% highest-posterior density interval, 162-232). Over 50% of the well-marked dolphins encountered throughout the study were sighted in more than one distinct coastal area, thus displaying high mobility. In addition, it was found that it would require biennial surveys to detect a 25% decline in abundance within the six-year reporting period of the EU's Habitats Directive. Given that the Special Area of Conservation designated for these dolphins consists of two separate areas covering a substantial portion of the west coast of Ireland, the multisite approach is appropriate for monitoring this population. It produces a more precise estimate and is well suited for sparse recapture data collected opportunistically at multiple sites, when the lack of resources prevents large-scale surveys or when concentrating surveys on smaller localized areas fails to capture the broad range and unpredictable occurrence of the animals. The Bayesian multi-site approach could be applied to the management of other wide-ranging marine or terrestrial taxa.",Diversity and diversification
27,"Indicators of Diptera diversity in wet grassland habitats are influenced by environmental variability, scale of observation, and habitat type","In low intensity agri-ecosystems such as wet grassland habitats, the inclusion of invertebrates in conservation assessments and monitoring is usually limited to charismatic groups such as bees or butterflies. However, wet grasslands support a wide range of inveterate groups, some of which may exhibit limited movement not generally represented by more mobile groups such as those typically examined. The use of surrogate species which exemplify broader invertebrate diversity has been suggested as a possible means of including these overlooked invertebrates (such as Diptera) in conservation planning within these habitats. Based on collections made by Malaise trap, we utilized two families of Diptera (Sciomyzidae and Syrphidae) as indicators of a wider range of dipteran diversity (nine Diptera families identified to parataxonomic unit level [PUs]) in wet grassland habitats. We examined the role of environmental variability, spatial scale, and habitat type on patterns of cross-taxon congruence for all three assemblages. Both environmental correlation and community congruence were significantly stronger among assemblages when examined at low spatial scales, highlighting the need to examine dipteran groups at scales untypical of current agri-environmental assessments; namely field and farm level. Furthermore, when wet grasslands were differentiated into two habitat categories (sedge and rush dominated grasslands), the significance of the community congruence increased markedly. This correlation was particularly strong between Sciomyzidae and PUs which demonstrated similar differentiation based on habitat type, implying that assemblages which exhibit comparable ecological partitioning are more likely to be useful surrogates of one another. Correlations between richness, abundance and Shannon's diversity were highly variable among groups, suggesting compositional analysis as the most appropriate examination of dipteran diversity for surrogacy studies. The results indicate that cross-assemblage congruence of Diptera is influenced by similarity of response to environmental variability, scale of observation, and examination of assemblages differentiated into appropriate habitat categories. The results illustrate the need to investigate invertebrate biodiversity surrogates at scales appropriate to the indicator groups and examine congruence among assemblages within specific habitat categories. Such an approach has the potential to maximise gamma diversity in areas where wet grasslands are under threat of intensification or abandonment.",Diversity and diversity
28,"Survival Rates and Capture Heterogeneity of Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Shannon Estuary, Ireland","Adult survival is arguably the most important demographic parameter for long-lived species as it has a large impact on population growth, and it can be estimated for cetacean populations using natural markings and mark-recapture (MR) modelling. Here we describe a 26-year study of a genetically discrete, resident population of bottlenose dolphins in the Shannon Estuary, Ireland, conducted by an NGO using multiple platforms. We estimated survival rates (SRs) using Cormack-Jolly-Seber models and explored the effects of variable survey effort, multiple researchers, and changes in camera equipment as well as capture heterogeneity induced by changes in marks and site fidelity variation, all common issues affecting longitudinal dolphin studies. The mean adult SR was 0.94 (?0.001 SD) and thus comparable to the estimates reported for other bottlenose dolphin populations. Capture heterogeneity through variation in mark severity was confirmed, with higher capture probabilities for well-marked individuals than for poorly marked individuals and a ?transience? effect being detected for less well-marked individuals with 43% only recorded once. Likewise, both SR and capture probabilities were comparatively low for individuals with low site fidelity to the Shannon Estuary, and SR of these individuals additionally decreased even further toward the end of the study, reflecting a terminal bias. This bias was attributed to non-random temporal migration, and, together with high encounter rates in Brandon Bay, supported the hypothesis of range expansion. Our results highlight the importance of consistent and geographically homogenous survey effort and support the differentiation of individuals according to their distinctiveness to avoid biased survival estimates.",Diverse sampling methods.
29,Sponge morphological diversity: a qualitative predictor of species diversity?,"1. To the non-specialist, problems are often associated with the quantification of sponge species diversity, as colour, shape and size can be highly variable within a single species. These variables can lead to an under-estimation of the contribution of sponges to the biodiversity of the benthos especially during biological surveys. 2. Sponge species diversity (Shannon H ' values), richness (mean number of species) and morphological diversity (Shannon H ' values) were sampled at six sites (6 m depth intervals) on vertical (90 degrees) and inclined surfaces (45 degrees) experiencing different flow regimes at Lough Hyne Marine Nature Reserve (Ireland). Morphological diversity was sampled independently of species diversity. The time taken for the collection of both species and morphological diversity was recorded. 3. Morphological diversity was positively correlated with both sponge species diversity (r(2) = 0.87, p < 0.05) and sponge species richness (r(2) = 0.70, p < 0.05). Linear regression was found to be significant for both the relationships (p < 0.05 for each F-value). A sigmoidal relationship (r(2) = 0.97, P < 0 05) was found between morphological and species richness which proved to be significant (F-value 40.67, p < 0.05). Separate Bray-Curtis dendrograms and correspondence analysis of morphological and species community compositions at the six sites showed very similar clustering and four major clusters were identified. 4. The results of the present study indicate that sampling of sponge morphological diversity, rather than sponge species diversity and richness may be used as a qualitative estimate of sponge species diversity. Sampling of morphological diversity is much less time consuming, both in the field and laboratory, than collecting species diversity data and no specialist knowledge is required. Consideration is given to the use of such relationships in biological surveys and bio-monitoring. Copyright <(c)> 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Conservation and economic diversification
30,A baseline study of metal ion content of Irish canals by ICP-MS,"The first systematic study of the metal ion content of the four main Irish Canal Systems is presented. Samples were collected seasonally over a twelve month period and analysed for 16 trace elements and metals by ICP-MS. The results show that three of the four canals (Royal, Grand, Shannon-Erne) have distinctly different elemental profiles, while the fourth (Barrow) is similar to the Grand Canal, which is to be expected, as they are broadly part of the same system, with a common main feeder. Spatial plots reveal local variations in certain elements, which are related to the nature of feeders in those localities. Simple tests based solely on the 16 elements measured showed that it may be possible to broadly define 'normal' compositions for each canal system, which can be then used to identify 'abnormal' data, and hence provide indicators for environmental change.",Environmental change and diversity.
31,Assessing candidate metrics for the ecological quality of TFTW (tidal freshwaters in transitional waters) in Ireland using benthic invertebrates,"There is an obligation under the Water Framework Directive (WFD, 2000/60/EC) not just to establish the ecological status of water bodies, but to ensure that they achieve 'good' quality. However, in some cases, the criteria have been difficult to establish, and one such case is that for Tidal Freshwaters in Transitional Waters (TFTW). In this study, based on 8 systems and 37 TFTW sites around Ireland, there were significant differences in invertebrate benthos, which was largely dominated by freshwater species. The evaluation of ecological status varied significantly across sampling methods which in turn were driven by the character of the substratum. The standard kick-sample method, in riffle conditions, yielded 69 taxa, cores in intertidal soft sediments 21 taxa, and grabs in the subtidal 15 taxa. The salinity (Practical Salinity Scale) at the study sites ranged from 0 to 29.3, although all but 3 were <5, but there was a greater consistency of community composition within a single TFTW across salinities than the converse. Diversity indices followed a similar although not identical pattern, with the Shannon-Weiner index (H') maxima being 2.24, 1.32 and 1.48 for kick samples, cores and grabs respectively. Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) scores were much closer, ranging from 4.5 to 6.1, 3.5-6.3 and 3.6-5.2 respectively, and in general, indices which included some measure of species' tolerance performed better than those based on diversity alone, but at the cost, in core and grab samples, of a very low information base (very few species contributing to the calculation). Of those metrics assessed, only ASPT could be put forward as a WFD candidate for quality assessment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Diversity and diversity
32,"CURRENT STATUS OF POLLAN COREGONUS AUTUMNALIS POLLAN IN LOUGH REE, IRELAND","The Irish pollan Coregonus autumnalis pollan is a unique and threatened freshwater fish species endemic to the island of Ireland, with its current known distribution limited to five lakes; Lough Neagh, Lower Lough Erne, Lough Allen, Lough Ree and Lough Derg. The Lough Neagh pollan are still relatively abundant, contributing approximately 25% of the total fish abundance. However, populations in Lower Lough Erne and the three Shannon lakes contribute < 1% of total fish abundance. As a result, pollan are listed as 'Endangered' in the Irish Red Data Book and the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Empirical data on pollan population size in Irish lakes is lacking, with current estimates based mainly on expert opinion. The current work combines new hydroacoustic data with an extensive gill netting survey, suggesting an abundance estimate for pollan greater than 10cm in length in Lough Ree to be in excess of 6000 individuals. The age classes 1 + and 2 + were captured and the hydroacoustic data displayed a strong cohort of 0 + fish, indicating reproductive success in the previous three years. This new abundance data contributes significantly to the knowledge of the Lough Ree pollan stock. Future and ongoing monitoring of population size, along with the identification of spawning locations, will help to inform management decisions aimed at protecting this unique and endangered fish species.",Conservation and management.
33,The early effects of afforestation on biodiversity of grasslands in Ireland,"The target rate of afforestation in Ireland over the next 30 years is 20,000 ha per year, which would result in an increase of the forest cover from the current 10% to 17%. In order to promote sustainable forest management practices, it is essential to know the composition and conservation value of habitats where afforestation is planned and the effects of subsequent planting upon biodiversity. The objectives of this study were to investigate changes in vegetation composition and diversity of grasslands 5 years after afforestation with Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and determine the primary ecological and management factors responsible for these changes. Species cover, environmental and management data were collected from 16 afforested and unplanted improved and wet grassland site pairs in Ireland. Our results indicate that 5 years after tree planting, there were significant changes in richness, composition, and abundance of species. Competitive and vigorous grasses were more abundant in planted than in unplanted sites, as were generalist species found in both open and wooded habitats, while small-stature shade-sensitive species were less abundant. Vascular plant species richness and Shannon's diversity index were higher in unplanted wet grassland, than in the planted sites. Bryophyte species richness was higher in planted improved grassland than in unplanted sites. The differences were primarily the result of the exclusion of grazing, ground preparation, changes in nutrient management and drainage for afforestation. Drainage ditches provided a temporary habitat for less competitive species, but the overall effect of drainage was to reduce the diversity of species dependent on wet conditions. Variance partitioning showed differences in the relative influences of environmental and management variables on biodiversity in the two habitats, probably due to the greater pre-afforestation grazing pressure and fertilisation levels in improved grasslands. The differences in biodiversity between planted and unplanted grasslands indicate that afforestation represents a threat to semi-natural habitats where distinctive and highly localised plant communities could potentially occur.",Diversity and diversity

36,Groundwater and wetland management in the Shannon river basin (Ireland),"This paper examined groundwater and wetlands in the Shannon river basin in the context of implementation of the European water framework directive (WFD). The particular wetland example of turloughs (groundwater fed temporary lakes in karst areas) was examined in the context of defining river basin district boundaries and in the delineation of their catchment areas for risk assessment as required by Articles 3 and 5, respectively of WFD. Groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystems such as turloughs are particularly challenging in terms of delineating their catchment areas for the purposes of risk assessment and implementation of measures. Turloughs are a habitats directive Annex I priority habitat, which occur mainly in Ireland and consequently, many turloughs in Ireland have been designated as special areas of conservation. Better understanding of such complex systems with high degrees of groundwater-surface water interaction will be required to ensure their protection in river basin management plans.

37,M-AMBI derived from taxonomic levels higher than species allows Ecological Status assessments of benthic habitats in new geographical areas,"Under the Water Framework Directive (WFD) benthic Ecological Quality Ratios (EQRs) are important tools for assessing Ecological Status (ES) of coastal and transitional waters. Calculation of the Multivariate-AZTI Marine Biotic Index (M-AMBI) EQR is based on the proportions of sensitive and stress tolerant benthic invertebrate species, number of species and Shannon-Wiener diversity. The sensitivity of many tropical/sub-tropical taxa has not yet been determined, presenting a barrier to the direct transfer of WFD EQRs, and the ideas underpinning them, to the management of coastal waters beyond Europe. To overcome this we examine using higher taxonomic level data with M-AMBI. Before applying such approaches to assessing ES in new geographical regions it is essential to determine the effects of using higher taxonomic level data on M-AMBI in areas where the tool was developed. To this end, we use macrofaunal data from three well studied sites in north-western Europe to examine the effects of using taxonomic level data higher than species on M-AMBI. Using the European datasets M-AMBI ES classification was shown to be robust to changes in taxonomic level data. We test the suitability of family-level M-AMBI for assessing ES in subtropical Hong Kong waters. Family level M-AMBI was useful in detecting stress in Hong Kong, where it successfully detected temporal and spatial shifts in ES in response to seasonal hypoxia and salinity variability, and anthropogenic organic enrichment.

38,"TREE DIVERSITY IN URBAN PARKS OF DUBLIN, IRELAND","Urban park, a major component of urban green infrastructure, is an indicator of urban ecological environment system. In this study, 34 urban parks divided into two categories (historical parks (HP) and modern parks (MP)) in Dublin were investigated in 2015; meanwhile, tree composition and diversity, importance value of species and families and size class distribution were compared between two kinds of parks. Result showed that 8603 trees belonging to 139 species, 67 genera and 37 families were enumerated, with 4174 in HP and 4429 in MP. Tree composition in both kinds of parks skewed toward alien tree species without significant difference. According to the species important value, top three tree species Ilex aquifolium, Acer pseudoplatanus and Platanus hispanica found in HP and Acer pseudoplatanus, Tilia sp. and Acer platanoides found in MP were all alien tree species in Ireland. The result of family importance value indicated that the most importance families were Aceraceae, Rosaceae and Tiliaceae in both kinds of parks. Species richness of HP was markedly richer than that of MP; while, the diversity index of Shannon-Wiener was not statistically significant between them. Based upon the relative abundance, several important tree species were more than 10 percent, which was not in accordance with the rule of thumb- 10/20/30. According to the size class of DBH distribution, two categories parks showed different preferences to trees in different historical periods; size class of tree height and crown displayed that communities were crowded in the urban parks of Dublin.

39,"Are Non-reef Habitats as Important to Benthic Diversity and Composition as Coral Reef and Rubble Habitats in Submarine Canyons? Analysis of Controls on Benthic Megafauna Distribution in the Porcupine Bank Canyon, NE Atlantic","Submarine canyons support high biomass communities as they act as conduits where sediments, nutrients, and organic matter from continental shelves, or those that are carried along by slope currents, are transported into the abyssal zone. The Porcupine Bank Canyon (PBC), located on the Irish continental margin and isolated from terrigenous inputs, reveals a complex terrain and substrate variation that affect the distribution of benthic fauna. Here, ROV-based benthic video, conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD), current velocity profiles, suspended particulate organic matter (POM) and bathymetric data were assessed to determine the controls on the distribution of benthic megafauna throughout the canyon. Multivariate analysis of the benthic community reveals significant differences in community structure among habitats and site locations throughout the canyon. Furthermore, these results show that non-reef habitats exhibit more variation in the composition of benthic taxa than coral reef and rubble habitats, with the following species contributing most to the structural differentiation between habitats: Leiopathes glaberrima (12.46%), Hexadella dedritifera (10.37%), Cidaris cidaris (9.31%), Aphrocallistec beatrix (9.33%), Araeosoma fenestratum (9.11%), Stichopathes cf. abyssicola (7.39%), Anthomastus grandiflorus (4.66%), and Benthogone rosea (3.84%). In addition, greater diversity, taxa evenness and high abundance of motile fauna were observed in non-reef habitat and the canyon flank. Seabed terrain features (depth, slope) are the most important environmental drivers that affect benthic taxa distribution while site locations and habitat type are the categorical variables that influence taxa distribution in the PBC. The highest mean current speed was observed on the canyon flank where the highest Shannon's diversity was recorded while mean current speed ranged from 18.2-31.3 cm s(-1). As the PBC is cut off from direct terrigenous input, this research contributes to understanding cold-water coral habitat responses to natural Northeast Atlantic environmental conditions. The findings of the current study will inform key stakeholders on how to responsibly interact with the canyon benthic habitats and can help inform policy makers on the effective conservation and management of the cold-water coral habitat in the PBC and other canyons.","Diversity, taxa and habitat"

Samples were digested individually and the levels of iron, zinc, manganese, cobalt, chromium and copper were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Levels of metals were lower than previously published values from Irish east coast estuaries, including Dublin, except for a few high levels in M. edulis, which did not persist in the tissues and were probably lost through excretion, spawning or detoxification. Of the metals analysed iron showed the highest levels. This was attributed in part to the background levels of iron in sediment. On some occasions high metal levels ill sediment did not lead to higher levels either in F. vesiculosus or in M. edulis, suggesting that metals in M. edulis may come from other sources, including anthropogenic inputs, in the estuary. On an international scale the levels in M. edulis of the six metals studied were relatively low in the Shannon Estuary. The longer-term monthly sampling regime followed in this Study is important since it shows that occasional high levels, which may be detected by once-off studies, are not always maintained.",Comparison of different approaches to collect and compare different approaches.
41,THE DISTRIBUTION AND EXPANSION OF ORNAMENTAL PLANTS ON THE SHANNON NAVIGATION,"Seven alien aquatic plants occur on the Shannon Navigation. Six ornamental plants have been recorded in Lough Derg. Two, Elodea canadensis and Lemna minuta, are widely distributed in the lough, locally abundant within the Navigation and the only alien plants found in Lough Ree. The species with the greatest impact, Elodea nuttallii, was first recognised in 2004 in harbours and cuts about the southern region of Lough Derg. It spread northwards by drifting fragments and almost certainly by leisure craft. Likewise, the fertile water violet, Hottonia palustris, originally found on the eastern side of the lake, has become abundant in sheltered shallows, reedbeds, canals and drains on the western side of the lake and continues to spread northwards and southwards. Confined populations of Stratiotes abides occur only on the western side of Lough Derg and may have been there for several years. An isolated population of a pink cultivar of Nymphaea alba, present for at least four decades, occurs in Lough Derg beside a lakeside domaine. Since the introduction of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, in c. 1993/4 there have been increases in water transparency that have presumably enabled some macrophytes to extend their ranges into deeper water. Given the likelihood of further range expansions or new introductions, regulation of the sale and distribution of alien aquatic species is needed to prevent further exotic plants from entering Irish waterways",Diversity and diversification.

Eels at this location occurred in high densities, had a slow growth rate and were predominantly male at maturation. Although they fed to some degree all year round, foraging activity of the eels was highest in the months of May to September, inclusive. Their diet, which was dominated by larval Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera, reflected the typical composition of the macroinvertebrate species assemblage of the riffle habitat sampled.

43,Assessment of biomarkers in Mytilus edulis to determine good environmental status for implementation of MSFD in Ireland,"Candidate OSPAR/ICES recommended biomarkers at the level of the individual in Mytilus edulis for determination of good environmental status for MSFD were evaluated against contaminant levels at sites around Ireland. The sites chosen ranged from moderate to low pollution levels, but the actual ranking of the sites varied according to the contaminant levels present. At the most contaminated site, Cork, 4 out of 16 contaminants exceeded the EAC, while at Shannon, no EACs were exceeded. The SOS assay suggested that Cork was the healthiest site with a LT50 of 17.6 days, while SOS for Shannon was 15.6 days. Likewise, condition factors varied among sites and did not always correspond to contaminant-based status. There may be uncertainty in assigning status around the not good:good boundary. This raises potential difficulties not only in the biomarker/contaminant load relationship but also in the reliability of the biomarkers themselves and hence barriers meeting compliance levels.

44,Distribution and abundance of bottle-nosed dolphins Tursiops truncatus (Montagu) in the Shannon Estuary,"The feasibility of developing commercial whale-watching in the Shannon Estuary was investigated by determining the distribution and abundance of bottle-nosed dolphins in the estuary. A variety of field techniques were employed, including photo-identification, fixed boat transects, scan sampling, minimum number estimates and the collection of incidental sightings over an eighteen-month period. Land-based observations showed that the presence of dolphins was influenced by the state of the tide, with a peak in sightings recorded three hours after high water. Dolphins were observed on 25 (61%) of 41 boat transects surveyed, of which sixteen turned into encounters, with dolphins sometimes present for many hours. A minimum number estimate conducted on 16 October 1994 showed that at least 56-68 animals were present, and photo-identification has recognised 25 animals individually. Dolphins were often recorded in discrete areas, especially off Kilcredaun Head, Beal Bar and off Leck Point. Sighting records from the Tarbert to Killimer ferry showed that dolphins were regularly seen especially in the spring and summer (May to August), being recorded on up to 88% of days in the month. Photo-identification showed that the same dolphins were present in the estuary throughout the study period, suggesting that they were resident. This is the first known resident population of bottle-nosed dolphins in Ireland. The implications of this work for the development of commercial dolphin-watching in the estuary are discussed.",Conservation and management

Contaminant levels, histopathology and several biological effects (BEs) including Lysosomal membrane stability (LMS), acetylcholinesterase (AChe), metallothionein proteins (MT) and alkali labile phosphate (ALP), in Mytilus edulis are presented, improving the current knowledge base for these data. Potential links between histopathology, BEs and contaminants and ranking of sites are investigated with an integrated response (IR) indexing technique. Histopathological condition indices (Ih) in mussel digestive gland are used to calculate health indices. A spatial and temporal assessment is conducted at Irish coastal locations. Linear mixed effects modelling revealed effects of confounding factors such as reproductive condition on NRRT (gonad stage (p < 0.001)). Higher prevalence of inflammation, brown cells and epithelial thinning of the digestive gland was evident at Dublin and Wexford and this linked well with the Ih. Levels of contaminants were generally found to be low with few exceptions as were BE responses. Using the IR approach, Dublin was ranked as being most impacted while Shannon ranked the least impacted, this being consistent with the BE ranking. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AT MAN-MADE OBSTACLES DURING UPRIVER SPAWNING MIGRATION: USE OF TELEMETRY TO ASSESS EFFICACY OF WEIR MODIFICATIONS FOR IMPROVED PASSAGE,"Artificial weirs on the Mulkear River present an obstacle to sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus L.) during upstream spawning migration. Telemetry to monitor passage success was undertaken in 2010 and repeated in 2011 following modifications to two of the weirs in the lower section of the river. Upstream migrants, captured downstream of the first weir, were radio tagged during 2010 (n = 51) and 2011 (n = 36). During both years tagged fish were experimentally re-released in two batches downstream (n = 20 both years) and upstream (n = 31 for 2010; n = 16 for 2011) of this structure, respectively. Subsequent telemetry conducted over nine weeks in 2010 suggested the majority of sea lamprey movements were downstream, with only one tagged fish ascending any of the weirs. Some fish spawned downstream of the first weir while other fish descended further to known spawning sites on the River Shannon both up and downstream of the Mulkear confluence. During 2011, localised movements were recorded up to but not across the first weir for the downstream-released fish. Of the 16 fish released upstream, three (19%) ascended the modified third weir and progressed further into the catchment compared with 0% (0/31) the previous year.",Relative to previous generations

This paper analyses data gathered over seven years from dolphin tour boats operating in the Shannon Estuary and examines whether there were any temporal or spatial trends in group size of the resident group of bottlenose dolphins in the region. Findings indicate that dolphin group size varied significantly between years (ANOVA, F = 4.55, P = 0.0001), and increased during the months of July, September and October (ANOVA, F = 8.921, P < 0.0001). Findings also reveal that group size of dolphins encountered in the middle part of the estuary was greater than the outer or inner estuary (ANOVA, F = 4.176, P < 0.001). The seasonal change in group size is thought to be primarily caused by dolphins switching to different prey species.","Food availability, social interactions and predator defence"

Plant biomass, densities of PAH-degradation soil bacteria, soil microbial biomass C and N, enzyme activities, and the physiological profile of the soil microbial community were determined. Average removal percentage of total PAHs in intercropping (30.5%) was significantly higher than in monoculture (19.9%) or unplanted soil (-0.6%). About 7.5% of 3-ring, 12.3% of 4-ring, and 17.2% of 5(+6)-ring PAHs were removed from the soil by alfalfa, with corresponding values of 25.1%, 10.4%, and 30.1% for tall fescue. Intercropping significantly enhanced the remediation efficiency. About 18.9% of 3-ring, 30.9% of 4-ring, and 33.4% of 5(+6)-ring PAHs were removed by the intercropping system. Higher counts of soil culturable PAH-degrading bacteria and elevated microbial biomass and enzyme activities were found after intercropping. Soil from intercropping showed significantly higher (p < 0.05) average well-color development obtained by the BIOLOG Ecoplate assay and Shannon-Weaver index compared with monoculture. Cropping promoted the dissipation of soil PAHs. Tall fescue gave greater removal of soil PAHs than alfalfa, and intercropping was more effective than monoculture. Intercropping of alfalfa and tall fescue may be a promising in situ bioremediation strategy for PAH-contaminated soils.",Plant bioremediation and bioremediation
49,Metal levels in seven species of mollusc and in seaweeds from the Shannon Estuary,"Metal levels (iron, zinc, manganese, cobalt, chromium, copper and nickel) were determined ill Cerastoderma edule, Mytilus edulis, Monodonta lineata, Patella vulgata, Nucelia lapillus, Littorina obtusata and L. littorea at two sires close to the mouth of the Shannon Estuary (Ireland) in November 1993 and May 1994, using standard atomic absorption spectrophotometer techniques. Samples of seaweeds were included at one shore for comparative purposes only. The best all-round indicators for all the metals studied were C. edule, M. edulis and N. lapillus. Metal levels ill the seaweeds were much lower than in the molluscs. No species was a universal indicator of the metals studied when site and season were taken into consideration. High levels of metals accumulated from water and/or sediment were observed in a number of cases. Levels of Zn in N. lapillus were significantly different to those in all other species and C. edule had high levels of Ni. These levels were dependent on site and season. A detrended correspondence ordination showed that the two species of bivalve mollusc and P. vulgata formed one cluster and that the remaining gastropod species formed a second cluster. This study shows that species-specific bioaccumulation occurs and is seasonally specific in certain species. This needs to be taken into account when choosing a bioaccumulator model and when comparing data from different studies.",Bibliography and systematics
50,The Use of Deep Water Berths and the Effect of Noise on Bottlenose Dolphins in the Shannon Estuary cSAC,"The Shannon Estuary on the west coast of Ireland is one of Europe's premier deepwater berths catering for ships up to 200,000 deadweight tonnage. It is also Ireland's only designated candidate special area of conservation for bottlenose dolphins under the EU Habitats Directive. Long-term static acoustic monitoring was carried out at a number of intensive shipping sites. In 2012, noise monitoring took place over a 6-month period (at 1 site) as part of Ireland's requirements under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). This is the first assessment of the potential effect of vessel traffic on the behavior of this discrete dolphin population.","Population, noise, and marine strategy"
51,"Fine-scale population structure and connectivity of bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, in European waters and implications for conservation","Protecting species often involves the designation of protected areas, wherein suitable management strategies are applied either at the taxon or ecosystem level. Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) have been created in European waters under the Habitats Directive to protect bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, which forms two ecotypes, pelagic and coastal. The SACs have been designated in coastal waters based on photo-identification studies that have indicated that bottlenose dolphins have relatively high site fidelity. However, individuals can carry out long-distance movements, which suggests potential for demographic connectivity between the SACs as well as with other areas. Connectivity can be studied using genetic markers. Previous studies on the species in this area used different sets of genetic markers and therefore inference on the fine-scale population structure and demographic connectivity has not yet been made at a large scale. A common set of microsatellite markers was used in this study to provide the first comprehensive estimate of genetic structure of bottlenose dolphins in European Atlantic waters. As in previous studies, a high level of genetic differentiation was found between coastal and pelagic populations. Genetic structure was defined at an unprecedented fine-scale level for coastal dolphins, leading to identification of five distinct coastal populations inhabiting the following areas: Shannon estuary, west coast of Ireland, English Channel, coastal Galicia, east coast of Scotland and Wales/west Scotland. Demographic connectivity was very low among most populations with <10% migration rate, suggesting no demographic coupling among them. Each local population should therefore be monitored separately. The results of this study have the potential to be used to identify management units for bottlenose dolphins in this region and thus offer a significant contribution to the conservation of the species in European Atlantic waters. Future studies should prioritize obtaining biopsies from free-living dolphins from areas where only samples from stranded animals were available, i.e. Wales, west Scotland and Galicia, in order to reduce uncertainty caused by sample origin doubt, as well as from areas not included in this study (e.g. Iroise Sea, France). Furthermore, future management strategies should include monitoring local population dynamics and could also consider other options, such as population viability analysis or the incorporation of genetic data with ecological data (e.g. stable isotope analysis) in the designation of management units.",Conservation and adaptation
52,The Inorganic Carbon Chemistry in Coastal and Shelf Waters Around Ireland,"The wintertime spatial distribution of carbonate parameters in outer estuarine and coastal waters around Ireland is described from total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) data collected between 2010 and 2013. Due to predominantly limestone bedrock of their river catchments, the River Shannon and Barrow, Nore and Suir River system export high concentrations (> 3800 mu mol kg(-1)) of TA to their estuarine and inshore coastal waters where estuarine alkalinity decreases with increasing salinity. TA is lower in rivers with a non-calcareous bedrock, with positively correlated alkalinity-salinity relationships in both the Lee and Foyle outer estuaries. Winter pCO(2) in the Shannon, Barrow/Nore/Suir and Lee estuaries is supersaturated relative to atmospheric CO2, while pCO(2) in the outer Liffey estuary is slightly lower than atmospheric CO2 in three consecutive winters, indicative of a CO2 sink. Winter pCO(2) is close to atmospheric equilibrium along the western shelf and through the centre of the Irish Sea, while it is a CO2 sink across the North Channel. While aragonite was supersaturated in most Irish waters, it was close to undersaturation in both the Lee estuary, attributed to its low alkalinity freshwater source, and Barrow/Nore/Suir estuary related to the flux of high concentrations of DIC from this river system. The seasonal impacts on inorganic carbon chemistry was also investigated by comparing winter and summer data collected between 2009 and 2013 along two transects in western coastal waters and along the western shelf edge. DIC was similar to 60 mu mol kg(-1) lower in summer relative to winter in the coastal transects and 39 mu mol kg(-1) lower along the shelf edge, accompanied by depleted nutrients and supersaturation of dissolved oxygen during summer, indicative of primary production. TA was generally higher in summer relative to winter corresponding with a decrease in nitrate, indicating that primary production dominated the TA distribution over calcification. An exception to this was at two stations along the shelf edge where TA was lower in summer relative to winter (51 mu mol kg(-1)) and coincides with high reflectance in satellite images from a coccolithophore bloom at the time of sampling. While pCO(2) was close to atmospheric equilibrium along the shelf edge during winter, this area was a CO2 sink during summer, apart from the stations where calcification was likely occurring resulting in elevated CO2 relative to atmospheric concentrations.",Winter and seasonal variability.
53,Investigation of the estrogenic risk to feral male brown trout (Salmo trutta) in the Shannon International River Basin District of Ireland,"The estrogenic potential of sewage treatment effluents and their receiving waters in the Shannon International River Basin District (SIRBD) of Ireland was investigated. An integrated approach, combining biological and chemical methods, was conducted to assess 11 rivers adjacent to sewage treatment plants (STPs) and their possible interference with the endocrine system of feral brown trout (Salmo trutta). Hepatosomatic index, gonadosomatic index, condition factor, histological (intersexuality) and endocrine (vitellogenin induction) parameters were assessed in a sample size of 10 at each location. The estrogenic burden was determined using an in vitro recombinant yeast assay containing the human estrogen receptor (YES assay). In addition, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) were quantitatively identified through a selection of pre-concentration techniques combined with chromatographic analysis at or near the selected locations. Chemical analysis of representative site samples identified phthalates and an alkylphenol in water and sediments in mu g/L and mg/kg concentrations, respectively. There were no significant difference in somatic indices or the condition factor between upstream control and downstream test sites, and there was no evidence of reproductive alterations or the presence of intersex in studied male brown trout. However, raised vitellogenin (vtg) levels were detected in the blood plasma samples of male brown trout at 8 of the 11 sites. Significant levels were reported at 3 of the positive sites (p <= 0.05). In one particular location, vtg induction was observed in 100% of the male brown trout sampled downstream. These findings were supported by the YES assay, where estrogenic activity was detected in the same upstream and downstream sites giving 17 beta-estradiol equivalency factor (EEF) values of up to 2.67 ng/L This study represents an integrated assessment approach, confirming the presence of estrogens in rivers of the SIRBD of Ireland, thus suggesting a cause-effect relationship to prolonged EDC-exposure in fish.

54,"EXTENSIVE HYBRIDISATION BETWEEN ROACH, RUTILUS RUTILUS L., AND COMMON BREAM, ABRAMIS BRAMA L., IN IRISH LAKES AND RIVERS","Widespread hybridisation between roach (Rutilus rutilus L.) and common bream (Abramis brama L.) was recorded throughout Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s following the establishment of invasive roach populations. To identify the post-invasion levels of hybridisation, a fish stock monitoring program was implemented in lake and river sites, predominantly within the extended River Shannon catchment. Roach x bream hybrids were the second or third most prolific fish recorded during these surveys, accounting for approximately 20%-30% of fish caught. The abundance of roach x bream hybrids is unique to Ireland and represents a potential threat to bream populations in invaded catchments.",roach and bream
55,"Pollution trace gases C2H6, C2H2, HCOOH, and PAN in the North Atlantic UTLS: observations and simulations","Measurements of the pollution trace gases ethane (C2H6), ethyne (C2H2), formic acid (HCOOH), and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) were performed in the North Atlantic upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere (UTLS) region with the airborne limb imager GLORIA (Gimballed Limb Observer for Radiance Imaging of the Atmosphere) with high spatial resolution down to cloud top. Observations were made during flights with the German research aircraft HALO (High Altitude and LOng Range Research Aircraft) in the frame of the WISE (Wave-driven ISentropic Exchange) campaign, which was carried out in autumn 2017 from Shannon (Ireland) and Oberpfaffenhofen (Germany). Enhanced volume mixing ratios (VMRs) of up to 2.2 ppbv C2H6, 0.2 ppbv C2H2, 0.9 ppbv HCOOH, and 0.4 ppbv PAN were detected during the flight on 13 September 2017 in the upper troposphere and around the tropopause above the British Isles. Elevated quantities of PAN were measured even in the lowermost stratosphere (locally up to 14 km), likely reflecting the fact that this molecule has the longest lifetime of the four species discussed herein. Backward trajectory calculations as well as global three-dimensional Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) simulations with artificial tracers of air mass origin have shown that the main sources of the observed pollutant species are forest fires in North America and anthropogenic pollution in South Asia and Southeast Asia uplifted and moved within the Asian monsoon anticyclone (AMA) circulation system. After release from the AMA, these species or their precursor substances are transported by strong tropospheric winds over large distances, depending on their particular atmospheric lifetime of up to months. Observations are compared to simulations with the atmospheric models EMAC (ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry) and CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service). These models are qualitatively able to reproduce the measured VMR enhancements but underestimate the absolute amount of the increase. Increasing the emissions in EMAC by a factor of 2 reduces the disagreement between simulated and measured results and illustrates the importance of the quality of emission databases used in chemical models.","Forest fires, anthropogenic pollution, and atmospheric pollution."
56,"THE CRYPTOGENIC RED ALGA BANGIA ATROPURPUREA IN LOUGH DERG, RIVER SHANNON, IRELAND","The filamentous and euryhaline red alga Bangia atropurpurea (Rhodophyta, Bangiophyceae) is a little-known member of the Irish aquatic flora. Although a common freshwater species in the northern hemisphere, it seems that the lower Shannon Navigation is one of the principal freshwater localities for the species in Ireland. It was recorded from thirteen sites in Lough Derg in 1972 and in the 2010 survey reported here at 40 sites including islands and navigation buoys as well as on lock gates. It attaches to rocks and other hard surfaces immediately above and below the waterline. It may have been introduced to Lough Derg on the hulls of commercial vessels. Changes in climatic conditions, eutrophication, competition from other filamentous algae and fluctuating lake levels are all pressures that could affect the sustainability of Bangia within the Shannon Navigation. Nevertheless, this study shows that B. atropurpurea has persisted for at least 40 years in Lough Derg and remains widespread despite highly variable environmental conditions.","Changes in climate, eutrophication, and fluctuating lake levels"
57,Using social media as a cost-effective resource in the photo-identification of a coastal bottlenose dolphin community,"Bottlenose dolphins encountered around the Irish coast are considered part of a wide-ranging coastal community; however, knowledge on the significance of the north of Ireland for this species is limited by a lack of dedicated effort. Through social media, the opportunity now exists to gather large volumes of citizen science data in the form of high-quality images, potentially extending the spatial and temporal scope of photo-identification studies. The purpose of this study was to investigate social media as a data resource for photo-identification studies and to provide a preliminary assessment of bottlenose dolphins in the north of Ireland. Specifically, the study sought to examine the photo-identification data for spatial clustering. The study identified 54 well-marked individuals and provided evidence of potential year-round occurrence, with successful re-sightings throughout the study period (2007-2016). There was a geographic concentration of re-sightings along the north of Ireland, suggestive of interannual site fidelity. These results provide scientific rationale for strategically targeting the north of Ireland in future research on the Irish coastal community. For effective conservation of the bottlenose dolphin it is imperative that scientific research, and resultant management objectives, consider wide-ranging communities such as the Irish coastal community. Our research highlights data collection via social media as a cost-effective and scientifically valuable tool in the photo-identification of coastal cetaceans. We recommend that this method is used in research on low-density and wide-ranging coastal cetaceans.",Conservation and research
58,FIRST REPORT OF INTERSEX ROACH RESIDING IN IRISH RIVERS DOWNSTREAM OF SEVERAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS,"Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are chemicals that have the ability to mimic or disrupt the endocrine system in wildlife. Many of these EDCs are present in treated Irish sewage effluents and landfill leachate and have recently been identified in Irish rivers. The effects of exposure to EDCs were investigated in Irish brown trout (Salmo trutta), sampled from selected Irish rivers downstream of Irish wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with control fish sampled upstream of the same WWTP. The effects were also investigated in Irish roach (Rutilus rutilus) sampled downstream of Irish WWTPs. Control roach were sampled from a pristine salmon fishery river (River Deel), located in the west of Ireland. Histopathological and macroscopic analyses of downstream trout showed no adverse reproductive effects, compared to control fish sampled upstream of the WWTP. Statistically significant (p < 0.05) populations of wild roach from three sampled Shannon basin rivers were, however, observed to be phenotypically intersex (ovo-testis) when compared to the control river. This, it is hypothesised, is as a direct result of exposure to WWTP effluents. The results reported herein are the first observations of intersex fish in Irish rivers.",Intersex fish
59,"PHOTO-IDENTIFICATION OF BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS (TURSIOPS TRUNCATUS) IN TRALEE BAY AND BRANDON BAY, CO. KERRY: A CASE FOR SAC BOUNDARY EXTENSION","The Lower River Shannon is a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) with bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) as a qualifying interest, and is one of only two SACs for this species in Ireland. Bottlenose dolphins in the Shannon Estuary are present year-round and genetically discrete from other populations in Ireland. They have regularly been reported from Tralee Bay and Brandon Bay, Co. Kerry, adjacent to the Lower River Shannon SAC boundary. In order to determine the provenance of these dolphins, photo -identification data collected between 2008 and 2016 from both bays were used to identify individuals and match them to existing bottlenose dolphin catalogues in Ireland. Bottlenose dolphins were observed on over 90% of the 13 trips carried out, with photo -identification data collected on 11 of these trips. A total of 70 individual dolphins were identified, of which 67 have been regularly recorded within the Lower River Shannon SAC, confirming them to be from this population. Shannon dolphins represented an average of 98% of dolphins photographed during each survey. Of the estimated 108 individual adult dolphins extant in the Shannon population, 62% were identified in Brandon Bay and/ or Tralee Bay during the study period. A discovery curve of individuals identified did not reach a plateau, suggesting that not all dolphins occurring in these bays were photographed during the study. Results suggest that these areas are of high importance to the Shannon dolphin population and support the need to extend the current boundary of the Lower River Shannon SAC to include Brandon Bay and Tralee Bay.",Multiple bottlenose dolphins are mentioned in the article.
60,"EVIDENCE OF THE WINTER OCCURRENCE OF THE WHITEFISH COREGONUS POLLAN THOMPSON, 1835 IN THE SHANNON RIVER, IRELAND","Coregonus pollan Thompson, 1835 is an Irish endemic whitefish with five known lake populations. Lough Derg has the most downstream population of three lakes in the Shannon catchment. We report on the occurrence of recently hatched larvae from a river section captured above Lough Derg during March 2011. This is the first indication of a downstream movement of larval pollan to a lake, which could have important implications for conservation of this red-listed teleost. This finding is consistent with earlier reports of adult pollan, in spawning condition, captured in fyke nets upstream of Lough Derg. There are also accounts of pollan spawning in the river section below Lough Derg during the 1960s, when they were once common.",Child exploitation and abandonment
61,Methyl-beta-cyclodextrin enhanced biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and associated microbial activity in contaminated soil,"The contamination of soils by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is a widespread environmental problem and the remediation of PAHs from these areas has been a major concern. The effectiveness of many in situ bioremediation systems may be constrained by low contaminant bioavailability due to limited aqueous solubility or a large magnitude of sorption. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MCD) on bioaugmentation by Paracoccus sp. strain HPD-2 of an aged PAH-contaminated soil. When 10% (W/W) MCD amendment was combined with bioaugmentation by the PAH-degrading bacterium Paracoccus sp. strain HPD-2, the percentage degradation of total PAHs was significantly enhanced up to 34.8%. Higher counts of culturable PAH-degrading bacteria and higher soil dehydrogenase and soil polyphenol oxidase activities were observed in 10% (W/W) MCD-assisted bioaugmentation soil. This MCD-assisted bioaugmentation strategy showed significant increases (p < 0.05) in the average well color development (AWCD) obtained by the BIOLOG Eco plate assay, Shannon-Weaver index (H) and Simpson index (X) compared with the controls, implying that this strategy at least partially restored the microbiological functioning of the PAH-contaminated soil. The results suggest that MCD-aided bioaugmentation by Paracoccus sp. strain HPD-2 may be a promising practical bioremediation strategy for aged PAH-contaminated soils.",Environmental degradation and bioavailability
62,"Integration of biological effects, fish histopathology and contaminant measurements for the assessment of fish health: A pilot application in Irish marine waters","This study investigates the use of a weight of evidence (WOE) approach to evaluate fish health status and biological effects (BEs) of contaminants for assessment of ecosystem health and discusses its potential application in support of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). External fish disease, liver histopathology and several BEs of contaminant exposure including 7-ethoxy resorufin O-de-ethylase (EROD), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), bile metabolites, vitellogenin (VTG) and alkali labile phosphates (ALP) were measured in two flatfish species from four locations in Ireland. Contaminant levels in fish were generally low with PCBs in fish liver below OSPAR environmental assessment criteria (EAC). There were consistencies with low PCB levels, EROD and PAH bile metabolite levels detected in fish. Dab from Cork, Dublin and Shannon had the highest relative prevalence of liver lesions associated with the carcinogenic pathway. An integrated biomarker response (IBR) showed promise to be useful for evaluation of environmental risk, although more contaminant parameters in liver are required for a full assessment with the present study.
